# netML Malware Detection

## Dataset Overview

This dataset focuses on detecting malware flows in network traffic through routers. The dataset is created for malware detection
task by obtaining 30 out of more than 300 raw traffic data from Stratosphere IPS. While the original dataset was released as features for the
[netML challenge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.13006.pdf), the dataset below represents a faithful recreation of the netML malware dataset at the raw
network packet level. Although the dataset doesn't perfectly match the original netML challenge, it is used in the nPrint paper.

## Task Description

The task is to identify the various malware and benign traffic flows in the dataset.

## Links and Facts
