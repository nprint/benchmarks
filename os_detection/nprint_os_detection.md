# nPrint OS Detection 

## Dataset Overview

This dataset was created by re-labeling the traffic originally captured in the [CICIDS 2017 dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html). The labels were generated by using the mapping of IP address
to operating system avaialble on the CICIDS website. The traffic was split first by the source IP address of each packet, and then split into 100 packet samples (sequentially). Although two versions
of the task were tested, the leaderboard and dataset below represent the harder OS detection task, across 13 classes.

## Task Description

The task is to classify the operating system of the device that sent each 100 packet sample.
